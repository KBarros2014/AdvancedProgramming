Hey,

Just two updates to our software layout.

As oppose to calling display_game_state() inside the game class after
each method has been called, call it from the controller class if a method such as move() returns true
this means messages will show up in the right order.

Look at Misa's code to see an example.

Secondly
Storing the north, east, south and west connections in the tile class makes the decision making
more complex with if statements when it comes to moving. When each connection is stored as a string
there had to be 4 seperate if statements at least to do the move function. Using a map of strings to
do this reduces this to a single if and a single line of code.

I.e.

if (direction != 'north' and direction !=  'east' and direction !=  'south' and direction !=  'west'):
    self.player_location = self.all_tiles[self.player_location].connections[direction]


Another update as per Misa's code.

String player_location

on the class diagram is now this

Tile player_location

Make sure to code to this.

Siggy.
